Kotlin Inheritance
Inheritance is one of the key features of object-oriented programming. It allows user to create a new class (derived class) from an existing class (base class).
The derived class inherits all the features from the base class and can have additional features of its own.

By default, classes in Kotlin are final. If you are familiar with Java, you know that a final class cannot be subclassed.
By using the open annotation on a class, compiler allows you to derive new classes from it.
